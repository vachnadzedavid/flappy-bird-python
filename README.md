Flappy bird is a game created in 2013 by a software engenieer, he later on stated that he felt guilty of posting it on the appstore and decided to remove it completely. But fortunetly the source code was shared online and remade. I personally did this with the help of a amazing yt tutorial.

Requirments to run this game:
-Python v 3.12 (P.S. Don't forget to add a variable path, so there isn't any errors.)

How to run?
1.Open cmd and put: run flappybird.py
2.Play the game!!

Hope you enjoy playing this flappy bird python game!! Kind Regards.
